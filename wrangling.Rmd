```{r}
# not using readr here as I think we want auto-factors?
df <- read.csv(
  '../code/dsbc_lectures/analysis/course_exemplar1.csv',
  skip=1  # column names are on second line of table
)

# rename the columns using the clunky base R syntax.
# sadly can't rename all columns by name
# with plyr as there are duplicate column names
names(df)[1] <- "num"
names(df)[2] <- "age"
names(df)[3] <- "sex"
names(df)[4] <- "group"
names(df)[5] <- "pain_pre"
names(df)[6] <- "pain_3"
names(df)[7] <- "pain_12"
names(df)[8] <- "pain_24"
names(df)[9] <- "pain_2wk"
names(df)[10] <- "mov_12"
names(df)[11] <- "mov_24"
names(df)[12] <- "mov_2wk"
names(df)[13] <- "par"

names(df)[15] <- "mor"
names(df)[16] <- "other"
names(df)[17] <- "days"
names(df)[18] <- "rat"
names(df)[19] <- "sat"

# all text to lower case
library(dplyr)
df <- mutate_each(df, funs(tolower))

# get rid of units in the drug columns and
# convert data type to numeric
df <- df %>%
  mutate(par = as.numeric(strsplit(as.character(par), "g"))) %>%
  mutate(cod = as.numeric(strsplit(as.character(cod), "mg"))) %>%
  mutate(mor = as.numeric(strsplit(as.character(mor), "mg")))
```

I can't be bothered to tackle the 'other' column at the moment but using **strsplit()** within **mutate()**, then chaining to **unnest()** is probably the way to start? See [here](http://bioinfoblog.it/2015/02/the-most-useful-r-command-unnest-from-tidyr/) and [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28938537/1684046).
