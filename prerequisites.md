Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants need to bring their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow. In exchange, you will leave with a working version of R, and the skills to use it.

*These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but working
through this lesson requires working copies of the software described below.
To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to install everything
*before* working through this lesson.

Please note **all of the requirements specified below are free**. Get in contact if you are about to hand over any money for this course because you shouldn't be.

## Pre-course Objectives 

- Install R
- Install R studio
- Sign up for a Google docs account
- Download and install a speadsheet programme
- Join Slack


## Steps

### 1. Charge your laptop

We'll provide a power bar, but it will be easier if you have a fully charged laptop. There are two lessons in each evening session, lasting around 45 minutes each so 2 hours of 'juice' should be enough.

### 2. Install R and R studio

We're going to get you up and running in **R** which is a highly respected, free statistics package used by academics around the world. We will also install a _friendly_ interface to R called _RStudio_.

1. Download and install R from [here](https://cran.rstudio.com)

2. Download and install RStudio. This is a nice shiny interface for R, and the easiest way to use it. Download it [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). There should be an 'installer' for your operating system.

### 3. Sign-up for a Google docs account.

We'll be using [Googlesheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) for two reasons. Firstly, they allow online collaborative editing. Secondly, starting your data 'pipeline' in the cloud will allow you to produce 'realtime' analytics.

Sign-up for an account at [here](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).

### 4. Download and install a Spreadsheet program

_Only, if you don't already have Excel or similar already installed._

### 5. Join our group on Slack

Slack is a geeky version of WhatsApp, but much better for coding and collaborating. We will use it to share files. You can use it chat, to ask questions, and later to become part of the [Datascience Breakfast Club](http://datascibc.org/about/).

See you there!
